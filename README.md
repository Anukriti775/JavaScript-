# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my JavaScript code, written as part of my learning process.  
You will notice a **gradual increase in complexity** as I progress and explore new concepts.  

## 📌 Purpose
- Track my JavaScript learning journey
- Practice coding regularly
- Experiment with different approaches and techniques

## 📂 Structure
Each file/folder represents code I wrote while learning.  
Earlier files are simpler, and over time the code becomes more advanced.  

## 🛠️ Topics Covered (so far)
- Basics of JavaScript (variables, operators, loops, functions)
- DOM manipulation
- Events & user interaction
- (More to come...)

💡 *This repo is a work in progress as I continue to grow my JavaScript skills.*
